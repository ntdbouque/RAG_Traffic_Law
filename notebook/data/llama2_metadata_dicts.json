The effect on MMLU-Humanities also positively influenced MMLU-Overall for the 70B model, although the difference was minimal.\n\n3. **Model Card**: A model card summarizes the Llama 2 model details, including:\n   - **Developers**: Meta AI\n   - **Variations**: Available in sizes 7B, 13B, and 70B, with pretrained and fine-tuned versions.\n   - **Architecture**: An auto-regressive language model using an optimized transformer architecture, trained with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with human feedback.\n   - **Training Dates**: January to July 2023.\n   - **License**: Custom commercial license available online.\n   - **Intended Use**: For commercial and research purposes in English, with specific out-of-scope uses outlined.\n   - **Training Factors**: Utilized Meta\u2019s Research SuperCluster and third-party cloud compute, with a significant carbon footprint offset by Meta\u2019s sustainability program.\n   - **Training Data**: Pretrained on 2 trillion tokens from publicly available sources, with fine-tuning data including human-annotated examples.\n   - **Evaluation Results**: Referenced in separate sections for pretraining, fine-tuning, and safety.\n   - **Ethical Considerations**: Acknowledges risks associated with the technology and limitations in testing scenarios.\n\nOverall, the section highlights the evaluation methodology, findings related to dataset contamination, and provides a comprehensive overview of the Llama 2 model's specifications and intended use.", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer": "Based on the provided context, here are five specific questions that can be answered using the information given, which are unlikely to be found elsewhere:\n\n1. **What specific datasets showed evidence of performance boost due to contamination in the training data, and how did the model sizes (7B vs. 70B) compare in terms of this effect?**\n   - The context indicates that only Hella Swag and MMLU-Humanities showed signs of performance boost due to contamination, with the 70B model benefiting more than the 7B model.\n\n2. **What are the key differences in intended use cases between the pretrained and fine-tuned variations of the Llama 2 model?**\n   - The pretrained models can be adapted for various natural language generation tasks, while the tuned models are specifically intended for assistant-like chat.\n\n3. **What was the total carbon footprint associated with the pretraining of the Llama 2 model, and how was it addressed?**\n   - The pretraining utilized 539 tCO2eq in emissions, which were fully offset by Meta\u2019s sustainability program.\n\n4. **What are the primary components of the model architecture for Llama 2, and how does it align with human preferences?**\n   - Llama 2 uses an optimized transformer architecture and employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align with human preferences for helpfulness and safety.\n\n5. **What are the limitations and ethical considerations associated with the use of the Llama 2 model as outlined in the model card?**\n   - The model carries risks with use, has been primarily tested in English, and does not cover all scenarios, indicating potential limitations in its applicability and safety."}, "node-92": {"section_summary": "The section discusses the following key topics and entities related to Llama 2:\n\n1. **Training Data**: Llama 2 was pretrained on 2 trillion tokens from publicly available sources, with additional fine-tuning data that includes over one million human-annotated examples.
