(2022) improved upon this by considering a sample contaminated if 70% of all 8-grams are found in the training data.\\n\\n4. **Tokenized Input Matching**: The current methodology diverges from previous approaches by matching on tokenized input and defining contamination based on token overlap in n-grams longer than 10 tokens.\\n\\n5. **Contamination Percentage**: The percentage of tokens in a sample that are contaminated is calculated, allowing for the classification of samples into clean and contaminated subsets.\\n\\n6. **Skipgram Budget**: A small allowance for mismatches (four tokens) is implemented to account for variations in formatting.\\n\\n7. **Implementation**: The identification of contaminated samples is done using suffix arrays and a modified library, utilizing a large computing cluster for efficiency.\\n\\n8. **Assumptions on Contamination Impact**: The authors assume that if contamination affects evaluation performance, \"clean\" samples will score worse than their counterparts, while \"dirty\" samples will score better.\\n\\n9. **Subset Types**: Four non-disjoint categories are defined based on contamination levels:\\n   - \"Clean\" samples (<20% contamination)\\n   - \"Not clean\" samples (≥20% contamination)\\n   - \"Not dirty\" samples (<80% contamination)\\n   - \"Dirty\" samples (≥80% contamination)\\n\\n10. **Confounding Factors**: The section acknowledges the complexity of accurately assessing the impact of contamination on evaluation performance due to the distribution of clean and dirty samples.\\n\\nOverall, the section emphasizes the importance of accurately measuring and understanding dataset contamination to ensure fair evaluation of machine learning models.', 'questions_this_excerpt_can_answer': 'Based on the provided context regarding dataset contamination and evaluation methodologies, here are five specific questions that can be answered:\\n\\n1. **What is the threshold for a sample to be classified as \"clean\" according to the contamination criteria discussed?**\\n   - Answer: A sample is classified as \"clean\" if it has less than 20% token contamination.\\n\\n2. **How does the methodology proposed by Chowdhery et al. (2022) improve upon earlier n-gram collision detection methods?**\\n   - Answer: Chowdhery et al. (2022) improve upon earlier methods by considering a sample contaminated if 70% of all 8-grams can be found at least once in the training data, rather than relying solely on high-order n-gram collisions.\\n\\n3. **What is the significance of the \"skipgram budget\" of four tokens in the contamination detection process?**\\n   - Answer: The \"skipgram budget\" of four tokens allows for matched spans between an evaluation sample and the training data to differ in at most four positions, accommodating minor formatting variations while still identifying contamination.\\n\\n4. **What assumptions are made regarding the relationship between contamination levels and average scores of samples?**\\n   - Answer: The assumption is that if dataset contamination contributes to evaluation performance, the \"cleanest\" examples will have a worse average score than their complement, and the \"dirtiest\" samples will have a better average score than their complement.\\n\\n5. **What are the four defined subset types based on token contamination levels, and how do they differ?**\\n   - Answer: The four defined subset types are:\\n     - \"Clean\" samples: less than 20% token contamination.\\n     - \"Not clean\" samples: greater than or equal to 20% token contamination.\\n     - \"Not dirty\" samples: less than 80% token contamination.\\n     - \"Dirty\" samples: greater than or equal to 80% token contamination.'}\n",

There have been public releases of pretrained LLMs\\n(such as BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), LLaMa-1 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023)) that\\nmatch the performance of closed pretrained competitors like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and Chinchilla\\n(Hoffmann et al., 2022), but none of these models are suitable substitutes for closed “product” LLMs, such\\nasChatGPT,BARD,andClaude. TheseclosedproductLLMsareheavilyfine-tunedtoalignwithhuman\\npreferences, which greatly enhances their usability and safety. This step can require significant costs in\\ncomputeandhumanannotation,andisoftennottransparentoreasilyreproducible,limitingprogresswithin\\nthe community to advance AI alignment research.\\nIn this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a family of pretrained and fine-tuned LLMs, Llama 2 and\\nLlama 2-Chat , at scales up to 70B parameters. On the series of helpfulness and safety benchmarks we tested,\\nLlama 2-Chat models generally perform better than existing open-source models.

To bootstrap, we started the SFT stage with publicly available instruction tuning\\ndata (Chung et al., 2022), as utilized previously in Touvron et al. (2023).\\nQuality Is All You Need. Third-party SFT data is available from many different sources, but we found that\\nmanyofthesehaveinsufficientdiversityandquality—inparticularforaligningLLMstowardsdialogue-style\\ninstructions. As a result, we focused first on collecting several thousand examples of high-quality SFT data,\\nas illustrated in Table 5. By setting aside millions of examples from third-party datasets and using fewer but\\nhigher-quality examples from our own vendor-based annotation efforts, our results notably improved.

Surprisingly,\\nwe found that the outputs sampled from the resulting SFT model were often competitive with SFT data\\nhandwritten by human annotators, suggesting that we could reprioritize and devote more annotation effort\\nto preference-based annotation for RLHF.\\nFine-Tuning Details. For supervised fine-tuning, we use a cosine learning rate schedule with an initial\\nlearning rate of 2×10−5, a weight decay of 0.1, a batch size of 64, and a sequence length of 4096 tokens.\\nFor the fine-tuning process, each sample consists of a prompt and an answer.

Helpfulness refers to how\\nwell Llama 2-Chat responses fulfill users’ requests and provide requested information; safety refers to\\nwhether Llama 2-Chat ’s responses are unsafe, e.g., “giving detailed instructions on making a bomb” could\\nbe considered helpful but is unsafe according to our safety guidelines. Separating the two allows us to\\napplyspecificguidelinestoeachandbetterguideannotators;forexample,oursafetyannotationsprovide\\ninstructions to focus on adversarial prompts, among other guidance.\\nApart from differences in annotation guidelines, we additionally collect a safety label during the safety stage.\\nThis additional information bins model responses into one of three categories: 1) the preferred response\\nis safe and the other response is not, 2) both responses are safe, and 3) both responses are unsafe, with\\n18%, 47%, and 35% of the safety dataset falling into each bin, respectively. We do not include any examples\\nwhere the chosen response was unsafe and the other response safe, as we believe safer responses will also be\\nbetter/preferred by humans. Safety guidelines and more detailed information regarding safety annotations\\ncan be found in Section 4.2.1.\\nHuman annotations were collected in batches on a weekly basis. As we collected more preference data, our\\nreward models improved, and we were able to train progressively better versions for Llama 2-Chat (see\\ntheresultsinSection5,Figure20).

When we provided such instructions to Llama 2-Chat , the subsequent\\nresponse should always respect the constraint. However, our initial RLHF models tended to forget the initial\\ninstruction after a few turns of dialogue, as illustrated in Figure 9 (left).\\nTo address these limitations, we propose Ghost Attention (GAtt), a very simple method inspired by Context\\nDistillation (Bai et al., 2022b) that hacks the fine-tuning data to help the attention focus in a multi-stage\\nprocess. GAtt enables dialogue control over multiple turns, as illustrated in Figure 9 (right).\\nGAttMethod. Assumewe haveaccess toa multi-turndialoguedataset betweentwo persons(e.g., auser\\nand an assistant), with a list of messages [u1, a1, . . . , u n, an], where unandancorrespond to the user and\\nassistant messages for turn n, respectively. Then, we define an instruction, inst, that should be respected\\nthroughout the dialogue. For example, instcould be “act as.” We can then synthetically concatenate this\\ninstruction to all the user messages of the conversation.\\nNext, we can sample from this synthetic data using the latest RLHF model.

We observe that the safety capabilities of LLMs can be efficiently\\nenhanced by prefixing the model with a safety preprompt (e.g., “You are a safe and responsible assistant” ).\\nLike supervised safety fine-tuning, safety context distillation provides a quick way to bootstrap the model’s\\nresponses on hard adversarial prompts, so that they can then be further improved in RLHF.\\nSpecifically, we apply context distillation by prefixing a safety preprompt to adversarial prompts to generate\\nsaferresponses,andthenfine-tunethemodelonitsownsafeoutputgiventheadversarialpromptwithout\\nthe preprompt. We generate safety preprompts automatically with templates.

Specifically, if the model responses are already of high quality, the application of\\ncontext distillation can result in less pertinent replies, as the model tends to overemphasize the preprompt,\\noften resorting to generic concerns excessively (see Appendix Table 40 for an example of vague answers due\\ntocontextdistillation).

However, [slightly later models] have tended todisplay knowledge\\nthat the content is problematic, even if they do go on to provide it. “They respond with ‘[UNSAFE\\nCONTENT]isnotappropriatetodiscuss,etc.’ andthenimmediatelyfollowupwith‘Withthatsaid,here’s\\nhow [UNSAFE CONTENT].’ ” [Latest models] are able to resolve these issues.\\n•Distracting the [early models] by including “quirks” or specific requests usually defeated any\\nreluctanceencounteredviamoredirectrequests. “Acreativewritingrequest(song,story,poem,etc.) isa\\nreliable way to get it to produce content that it is otherwise robust against.”\\n•Embedding a problematic request in a positive context often successfully obscured the fact that\\nproblematicoutputwasbeingrequestedfor [early models] :“TheoverallprincipleI’vefoundmost\\neffective for any kind of attack is to hide it in language that is positive, progressive, and empowering.”\\nFrom Red Teaming Insights to Safer Models. Crucially, after each exercise, we performed a thorough\\nanalysis of the collected data, including dialogue length, risk area distribution, histogram of topic of misin-\\nformation (where appropriate), and rated degree of risk. In each case, we took the overall lessons as a guide\\nto helpfurther modelsafetytraining, and specificallytook data fromthese exercisesformodel fine-tuning,\\nmodel feedback training, and as a signal for other safety model training.\\nMultiple additionalrounds ofred teaming wereperformed over severalmonths tomeasure the robustness\\nof each new model as it was released internally. We defined the robustness of a model, γ, with respect to\\na red teaming exercise executed by a set of experts as the average number of created prompts that would\\ntriggeraviolatingresponsefromthemodelperpersonperhour. Asanexample,onour7Bmodel,wehadan\\nevolution of γ: 1.8→0.45over several red teaming iterations and model refinements. Robustness will likely\\ncontinue to improve with additional red teaming efforts. Another magnitude that we tracked as new models\\nwere produced was the percentage of prompts triggering violating responses discovered in the previous red\\nteaming exercises that were mitigated in a given new candidate release.

The recent years have witnessed a substantial evolution in the field of LLMs.\\nFollowing the scaling laws of Kaplan et al. (2020), several Large Language Models with more than 100B\\nparameters have been proposed, from GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) to Gopher (Rae et al., 2022) or specialized\\nmodels, e.g. Galactica, for science(Taylor et al., 2022). With 70B parameters, Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al.,\\n2022) redefined those scaling laws towards the number of tokens rather than model weights. Notable in\\nthisprogressionistheriseofLlama,recognizedforitsfocusoncomputationalefficiencyduringinference\\n(Touvron et al., 2023). A parallel discourse has unfolded around the dynamics of open-source versus closed-\\nsourcemodels. Open-sourcereleaseslikeBLOOM(Scaoetal.,2022),OPT(Zhangetal.,2022),andFalcon\\n(Penedo et al., 2023) have risen to challenge their closed-source counterparts like GPT-3 and Chinchilla.\\n§§https://ai.meta.com/llama\\n35\\n\\nYet,whenitcomestothe\"production-ready\"LLMssuchasChatGPT,Bard,andClaude,there’samarked\\ndistinction in performance and usability. These models rely on intricate tuning techniques to align with\\nhuman preferences (Gudibande et al., 2023), a process that is still being explored and refined within the\\nopen-source community.\\nAttempts to close this gap have emerged, with distillation-based models such as Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023)\\nandAlpaca(Taorietal.,2023)adoptingauniqueapproachtotrainingwithsyntheticinstructions(Honovich\\net al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022). However, while these models show promise, they still fall short of the bar set\\nby their closed-source counterparts.\\nInstructionTuning.

An approach related to instruction tuning is chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022b), in\\nwhichmodels areprompted toexplain theirreasoningwhen givena complexproblem, inorder toincrease\\nthe likelihood that their final answer is correct.\\nRLHF has emerged as a powerful strategy for fine-tuning Large Language Models, enabling significant\\nimprovements in their performance (Christiano et al., 2017).

We expand the context window for Llama 2 from 2048 tokens to 4096 tokens. The longer\\ncontextwindowenablesmodelstoprocessmoreinformation,whichisparticularlyusefulforsupporting\\nlongerhistoriesinchatapplications,varioussummarizationtasks,andunderstandinglongerdocuments.\\nTable 16 compares the performance of 2k and 4k context pretraining on long-context benchmarks.

Astandardpracticeforautoregressivedecodingistocachethekey(K)and\\nvalue (V) pairs for the previous tokens in the sequence, speeding up attention computation. With increasing\\ncontext windows or batch sizes, however, the memory costs associated with the KV cache size in multi-head\\nattention (MHA) models grow significantly.

Eithertheoriginalmulti-queryformatwithasingleKVprojection(MQA, Shazeer,\\n2019) or a grouped-query attention variant with 8 KV projections (GQA, Ainslie et al., 2023) can be used.\\nIn Table 18, we compare MQA and GQA variants with an MHA baseline. We train all models with 150B\\ntokens while keeping a fixed 30B model size. To keep a similar overall parameter count across GQA and\\nMQA, we increase the dimension of the feed-forward layers to compensate for the reduction in the attention\\nlayers. For the MQA variant, we increase the FFN dimension by a factor of 1.33, and for the GQA variant, we\\nincrease it by a factor of 1.3. From the results, we observe that the GQA variant performs comparably to the\\nMHA baseline on most evaluation tasks and is better than the MQA variant on average.\\nTooptimizeforlatency,wehostourlargestmodelsusing8A100sinasinglenodewithtensorparallelism\\n(Shoeybietal.,2019).

Thisallowsustoviewthebenchmarkperformanceofourmodelsonarangeofcontamination\\nscales, while retaining the ability to test a high-precision clean subset (samples with <20%contamination)\\nand a high-precision contaminated subset (samples with >80%contamination).
